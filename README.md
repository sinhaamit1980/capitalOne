# Card Game Test





### Running The Test

To run the test issue a command similar to:

```
   ruby run_card_game_test.rb "<path_to_the file including filename>"
```
For example I have added one test file to the folder location and in my case
 ```
 ruby run_card_game_test.rb "/Users/amitsinha/apps/projects/capitalOne/card_test_file.txt"
```
